<p>Couple of days ago I came up with an idea of creating SMIL animated Pacman. But what is the best way how to do it? It was (and still is) haunting me, although I was able to solve this issue in many different ways. 
One is very short in code, another best cross-browser compatible, another best looking... really hard to decide. Here is my current work status - can you tell me of another way how to do it? ;-)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="pacman/pills.svg">Pacman's Pills (mask over horizontally transformed dashed line)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman1.svg">Pacman 1 (45 degrees rotated rectangular, animated its scale to create mouth, as a mask over circle)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman2.svg">Pacman 2 (two paths, as a first and last position of animation, animated by d attribute)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman3.svg">Pacman 3 (two animated rectangulars in a mask to create mouth, then applied to the circle)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman4.svg">Pacman 4 (animated linear gradient applied to two circles)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman5.svg">Pacman 5 (path in shape of half circle, rotated and re-used)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman6.svg">Pacman 6 (circle with very thick stroke having animated its dasharray)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman7.svg">Pacman 7 (circle and ellipse with animated ry attribute, both in a mask over circle)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacman8.svg">Pacman 8 (two circles, rotated, over each applied simple rectangular mask)</a></li>
<li><a href="pacman/pacmans.svg">Pacman Cloud (everything put - well, copy&amp;pasted - together ;-)</a></li>
</ul>
